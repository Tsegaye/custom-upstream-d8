# External Data Source

Provides functionality for fetching Data from External APIs and displaying fetched data as a field options.
## Installation
Since the module can require external libraries, Composer or Ludwig must be used.

### Composer
If your site is [managed via Composer](https://www.drupal.org/node/2718229), use Composer to
download the module, which will also download the required libraries:
   ```sh
   composer require "drupal/external_data_source ~1.0"
   ```
~1.0 downloads the latest release, use 1.x-dev to get the -dev release instead.
Use ```composer update drupal/external_data_source --with-dependencies``` to update to a new release.
